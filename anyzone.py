AnyZone - DNS zones for everyone, custom made for any IP!

Usage:
  {sys.argv[0]} <zonename> <serverip>

Where
  <zonename> is the name of our zone that was delegated to this server,
      e.g. ns.example.org.
  <serverip> is the IP of this system, to answer A <zonename> queries,
      e.g. 45.80.169.218 (todo: add ipv6 support for this)

In your domain's DNS settings, you need to delegate this <zonename> to a name
which then has an A record for <serverip>. Once you have done that, you will
be able to query:

  $ dig anything.192.168.1.1.<zonename>  # ask 192.168.1.1
  $ dig anything.2001idb8ii1.<zonename>  # ask 2001:db8::1

The queries will show up on the respective IPs, relative to the resolver (by
default, probably your ISP). The point is that you can fill in any IP, both v4
and v6, and you will get the traffic for it on your server. The intended
purposes are penetration tests and DNS tunneling.

The project is pure Python and meant to handle Internet exposure, but it has
not been audited for security. Deployment on an isolated, unimportant system,
IP address, and domain is the recommended setup.

Global issues: Warn/Error/Fatal (stderr)
One client having trouble: Info (stdout)
Normal operation: Debug (stdout)
On startup, if Python throws a backtrace (e.g. fails to bind to port), Python
will not use this convention as well as exit.
